# Summary of Changes: Production-Ready Solana Portfolio Dashboard

## 1. Calculation Corrections
- **SOL Balance:**
  - Now displayed in SOL (converted from lamports using 1 SOL = 1,000,000,000 lamports).
- **Token Amounts:**
  - Displayed as human-readable values using their decimals (e.g., 1,000,000 with 6 decimals = 1.00 token).
- **Total Portfolio Value:**
  - Calculated as the sum of formatted token amounts (not raw integers).

## 2. Design & UX Improvements
- **Branding:**
  - Added Third Time logo and branding to the header.
  - Logo text is black in light mode and white in dark mode; PNG logo is always visible.
- **Color Scheme:**
  - Updated to a cohesive purple/violet theme for both light and dark modes.
- **Responsiveness:**
  - Cards stack vertically on mobile and display in a row on desktop, with no horizontal scrolling.
  - Layout uses flexbox and responsive widths for best practice.
- **Professional Appearance:**

  - Modern, visually appealing heading with subtitle.
- **Mint Address:**

- **Header & Navigation:**
  - Menu/X icon is now left of the logo, toggles sidebar, and only appears in one place at a time.
  - Home button in mobile menu now closes the sidebar and navigates home.


## 3. Best Practices & Code Quality
- **TypeScript:**
  - Type safety improved for calculation helpers.
- **React Patterns:**
